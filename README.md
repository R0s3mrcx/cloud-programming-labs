# Cloud Programming Labs — JavaScript & Python

This repository contains **JavaScript (ES6)** and **Python** laboratory exercises for the **Cloud Programming** course.

Each exercise is implemented in a **separate file**, follows the official **exercise ID naming convention**, and is committed **individually** (one subtask = one commit) to ensure transparent and traceable grading.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by **language** and **task**, following the structure recommended by the course.

### JavaScript exercises
